    What I have learned this year in Language & Literature:
    <br>
    Our current unit of study is Brain Science. We read Phineas Gage: A Gruesome But True Story of Brain Science as well as excerpts from Inventing Ourselves: The Secret Life of the Teenage Brain. We wrote an argumentative essay on the prompt “Should adolescents be treated differently in the legal system?” We just completed that essay right before conferences. 
    <br> <br>
    Criterion B: Organizing - Book review. I worked on organizing my thoughts and ideas into paragraphs. I included transitions and supporting details. 
    <br> <br>
    Criterion D: Using Language - Grammar Assessments. I have been practicing to improve my grammar, syntax, and punctuation. We have learned part of a sentence, coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS), and how to write sentences with compound subject, compound predicate, and/or compound direct object. We also have learned to correctly punctuate compound sentences.  I have been growing my vocabulary through my independent reading, our all-class short story unit, our all-class The Call of the Wild unit, and my independent practice on Amplify. I wrote a vocabulary short story to show how I can use new words in my writing. 
    <br> <br>
    Criterion A: Analyzing - Short Story Plot Roller Coasters, The Call of the Wild character Analysis, Reading Assessments in Amplify, quick writes in Amplify.  I read short stories and learned to look for short story elements such as point of view, rising action, the climax of the story, and characters. I also looked for literary devices such as imagery. The Amplify Reading Assessments allow me to demonstrate my reading comprehension skills with very challenging questions. The Amplify quick writes let me practice including text evidence to support my claim. 
    <br> <br>
    Criterion C: Producing Text - The Call of the Wild poems. We wrote poems from a character’s point of view or about a scene in the novel. I practiced including literary devices such as imagery, simile, metaphor, and personification in my poem.
