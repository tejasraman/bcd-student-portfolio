      My work samples I will share are my poem, my plot coaster, and my character analysis.
      <br><br>
      What I have learned this year in Language & Literature:
      <br>
      Our current unit of study is Brain Science. We read Phineas Gage: A Gruesome But True Story of Brain Science as
      well as excerpts from Inventing Ourselves: The Secret Life of the Teenage Brain. We wrote an argumentative essay
      on the prompt “Should adolescents be treated differently in the legal system?” We just completed that essay right
      before conferences.
      <br> <br>
      Criterion B: Organizing - Book review. I worked on organizing my thoughts and ideas into paragraphs. I included
      transitions and supporting details.
      <br> <br>
      Criterion D: Using Language - Grammar Assessments. I have been practicing to improve my grammar, syntax, and
      punctuation. We have learned part of a sentence, coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS), and how to write sentences
      with compound subject, compound predicate, and/or compound direct object. We also have learned to correctly
      punctuate compound sentences. I have been growing my vocabulary through my independent reading, our all-class
      short story unit, our all-class The Call of the Wild unit, and my independent practice on Amplify. I wrote a
      vocabulary short story to show how I can use new words in my writing.
      <br> <br>
      Criterion A: Analyzing - Short Story Plot Roller Coasters (IB 6), The Call of the Wild character Analysis (IB 8),
      Reading
      Assessments in Amplify, quick writes in Amplify (IB 7). I read short stories and learned to look for short story
      elements
      such as point of view, rising action, the climax of the story, and characters. I also looked for literary devices
      such as imagery. The Amplify Reading Assessments allow me to demonstrate my reading comprehension skills with very
      challenging questions. The Amplify quick writes let me practice including text evidence to support my claim.
      <br> <br>
      Criterion C: Producing Text - The Call of the Wild poems (IB 8). We wrote poems from a character’s point of view
      or about
      a scene in the novel. I practiced including literary devices such as imagery, simile, metaphor, and
      personification in my poem.

            As I slept on that cold night<br>
            a call so strong and bright<br>
            pulled at me with all its might<br>
            and I could not put up a fight.<br>

            This call was distinct and many-noted<br>
            and through my fear I had voted;<br>
            I had to go, I had to know<br>
            where I had heard that call before.<br><br>

            As I ran toward the sound<br>
            A timber wolf was what I found;<br>
            Seeing him howl up at the moon<br>
            I knew in my heart that I would too<br><br>

            The timber wolf was lean and slim<br>
            and off his fur the moonlight did glint;<br>
            and his howl was a mournful song<br>
            but he ran when he saw me, and his strides were long<br><br>

            I sat in the clearing, and I saw the light of the moon<br>
            and felt the grass and rocks underfoot;<br>
            and smelled the smells of the forest a-stirring<br>
            and heard the wind and the insects chirping.<br><br>

            And as he saw that I was friend, not foe<br>
            he didn’t try to avoid me anymore<br>
            and just as he started to accept me<br>
            I realized where I had to be<br><br>

            I had to go back to the camp<br>
            and it was to the camp that I tramped;<br>
            but it was when I saw the light<br>
            I knew I would never forget that night.<br><br>
