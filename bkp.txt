<p>In Language & Literature, we have been talking about grammar, doing personalized vocabulary training, reading books, understanding and drawing connections from books, and writing argumentative essays.</p> <br><br> <div class="row"><div class="columntwo"><p>We are currently reading <i>Merci Suarez Changes Gears</i> in Language and Literature. We have been discussing the books, predicting what will happen, and talking aout text connections(connections you can make from the book to yourself or another book or text. <br><br> <p>WHat we currently know about the book is that it is about a girl, and her grandfather is being weird lately, and she has to help a new kid at school. I currently suspect that the grandpa(Lolo) has Alzhiemer's disease, and there are some clues in the book about that.<br> She lives nextdoor to her grandma/grandpa and her aunt and cousins. She is in 6th grade.</p> </div> <div class="columntwo"><img width="80%" src="assets/merci-suarez.jpg"> </div></div>

<p>In October and November, we were writing <a style="color: black;" href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AkBuD6XsET8xhi4BWZQsJK8TTWql?e=Frr2XS">argumentative essays</a> talking about whether Halloween should be on a Sunday or not. I think that Halloween should be on a Sunday, and that it would make Halloween considerably more safe. I got an IB 7 on my essay.  <br><br>I found many improvements I could make in the first draft, and I feel that thorougly proofreading and rewriting through the course of the drafts a little bit goes a long way in terms of making an essay better. I usually keep similar wording to the drafts, but this helped me a lot.</p>
